The patrols continue.On land, the Home Guard was temporarily deployed to help Norwegian police patrol onshore oil and gas installations.In addition, energy major Equinor surveyed key gas export pipelines, such as the Europipe II link to Germany, on behalf of Gassco.It used specialised vessels equipped with remotely operated underwater vehicles that scanned the pipelines for anything out of the ordinary, like damages, foreign objects or ground disturbances.Equinor found nothing suspicious, its head of security and safety told Reuters in May.Norway designated Equinor and Gassco as companies critical to national security, and collaboration between energy companies and the country's intelligence services was stepped up.More company executives than before were screened to receive security clearances so that they could read classified intelligence updates."We meet regularly with the Norwegian security authorities to ensure a common understanding of risk and the situation, and we assess the risk picture and measures on an ongoing basis," an Equinor spokesperson said this week.In January, Equinor CEO Anders Opedal was invited to NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss ways to better protect offshore energy installations, the first time an Equinor chief was invited to do so.And in February, NATO established a taskforce dedicated to the protection of undersea infrastructure to improve cooperation between the military and the energy industry.However, "a key bottleneck continues to be surveillance, monitoring and information sharing, both between civil and military actors, states and in the region," Christian Bueger, a professor of international relations at the University of Copenhagen, said."NATO doesn't have any credible means to reciprocate, other than speeding the work on critical maritime infrastructure protection and surveillance," he added.(Reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis and Nora Buli; editing by Gwladys Fouche and Susan Fenton)TRENDING 1.
