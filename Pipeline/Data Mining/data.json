  "0":"Get ready for a New Year bonanza. With the general elections due in the first half of 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government is working on huge cuts \u2013 upwards of Rs 8 per litre -- in the retail prices of petrol and diesel that would be announced before the calendar year ends.\n\nAccording to sources, the Petroleum Ministry has prepared a proposal incorporating the cuts ranging from Rs 8 to Rs 10 per litre in both fuels for the Prime Minister\u2019s approval which could come on Thursday.\n\nThe rationale for the ministry\u2019s proposal for the huge reductions is the sharp drop in the purchase price of imported crude oil that goes into refineries to produce these two fuels, among others.\n\nCrude oil price during financial 2023-24 (April-March) so far was at an average of $77.14 per barrel with only two months -- September at $93.54 and October at $90.08 \u2013 witnessing a spike. The average crude oil price in 2022-23 was $93.15 a barrel.\n\nWith ex-refinery prices of the two fuels unchanged since 6 April 2022, the current fiscal\u2019s low crude oil prices have yielded large profits for the three government-run oil marketing companies -- Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL). In the first six months of this fiscal year, IOC, BPCL and HPCL made a combined net profit of Rs 58,198 crore.\n\nFor the losses in the last fiscal 2022-23 due to $90-plus crude prices, the Union Budget for 2023-24 announced a support of Rs 30,000 crore for the three government-run oil marketing companies as equity infusion under the guise of funding their green carbon initiatives but the money was not devolved due to this fiscal year\u2019s bounty.\n\nSources said that the price cuts could also be a clarion call from the ruling party of its intention to announce the elections early to ride on the landslide victories in three of the four big states. It would surely help quell the Opposition\u2019s agenda to project inflation as the government\u2019s biggest failure, they added.",

When the plant starts methanol production, it will save \u20b91,000 crore worth of crude imports annually, NLC India\u2019s Chairman and Managing Director, M Prasanna Kumar, told businessline today.\n\nThe plant will produce 400,000 tonnes of methanol using 2.5 million tonnes of lignite.\n\nNLC has been assured that it would get \u20b9600 crore viability gap funding from the government, but Kumar expects the funding to go up to \u20b91,000 crore, given that certain conditions for the additional funding have been met.\n\nAir Products of USA is the technology partner for the project. Government of India-owned Engineers India Ltd is the project manager.\n\nIn coal-to-methanol or lignite-to-methanol plants, coal or lignite is first gasified into synthesis gas (syn gas) by mixing pulverized coal or lignite with an oxidant such as oxygen or steam. The syn gas \u2014 which is very hot (about 1,800 degrees Celsius) \u2014 is a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen and is a building block for producing a range of chemicals, including methanol.\n\nAs such, the process is divided into two parts \u2013 lignite to syn gas and syn gas to methanol. NLC has floated two separate tenders for awarding the projects.\n\nThe technical bids have been opened for the lignite to syn gas package; three parties have submitted bids. Kumar is hopeful of being able to award the project by the end of January 2024.\n\nFor the syn gas to methanol project, the last date to submit bids is December 30.\n\nKumar expects work on the project to commence by March.\n\nThe government of India plans aims at the country having 100 million tonnes of coal or lignite gasification plants by 2030. Currently, five projects are underway\u2014the Talcher project, which is a joint venture of Coal India, RCF, GAIL and FCIL) and the projects of Eastern Coalfields, Western Coalfields, Mahanandi Coalfields\u2014and NLC.\n\nNorth Dhadu coal block\n\nMeanwhile, NLC, which had won the North Dhadu coal block in Jharkhand through a commercial auction in August, received the formal \u2018allotment order\u2019 last week, Kumar said.\n\nNLC planned to produce 3 mtpa of coal from the block, but now it feels that production could go up to 4 \u2013 5 mtpa.",

  "6":"wti-usd\n\nCrude oil has been sliding for a few months, with highs decreasing and moving averages acting as resistance. The decline continued and WTI crude fell below $68. However, buyers have returned, and we have been seeing considerable buying pressure in the last two weeks, pushing the price above $76 yesterday.\n\nHowever, the global economy is still slowing. But, there have been some positive numbers recently, and we have seen some demand return, adding here the rising geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea. On the back of Middle East concerns, a barrel of WTI Oil finally broke above the $74-75 resistance zone, peaking just above $76\/barrel yesterday.\n\nWTI Oil H4 Chart \u2013 Will the 200 SMA Hold As Support\n\nConsidering the magnitude of challenges in the region, the optimistic market reaction appears to be relatively weak. However, traders are cautious so the rally will most likely continue but continue at a slow pace. WTI crude has pushed above all moving averages on the H4 chart, as shown above, which turned into support eventually.\n\nThe 200 SMA (purple) was stopping the climb higher last week, acting as resistance, while the 100 SMA (green) was acting as support. But the 200 SMA was broken after the spike higher yesterday, due to the thin liquidity conditions in financial markets as well. Today we are seeing a retreat lower, but the 200 is now acting as support, however, let\u2019s see if it will hold.\n\nIf it does, then the next natural goal for WTI Oil bulls is the 200 moving average on the daily chart, which comes at $78, with the price likely to face decent resistance at this area. According to energy experts, there isn\u2019t much OPEC+ can do to raise prices beyond this point. This is because the United States has been producing massive amounts of crude Oil, setting new records for production and crude Oil exports. \u201cOPEC+ just can\u2019t cut enough to sustain a price much above where we are right now,\u201d Once Upon a Time Capital\u2019s John Kilduff said yesterday. We decided to open a buy Oil signal yesterday at the 200 SMA, hoping for a bounce off this moving average.",

  "9":"Fuel Price Reduction in 2024: A Possibility Amid Crude Oil Volatility and Red Sea Crisis\n\nIndustry insiders have hinted at a potential reduction in fuel prices if crude oil prices continue to hover below the $75 per barrel mark. However, this optimistic outlook is tinged with caution due to the ongoing crisis in the Red Sea region, a critical artery of global oil trade. Recent fluctuations in Brent crude oil prices, bouncing back from $73 to $80 per barrel as noted by Sapna_CNBC, underscore the volatility of the oil market and its potential impact on fuel prices.\n\n2024 Fuel Price Forecast and Potential Risks\n\nGasBuddy, a popular fuel price information service, has projected an average gas price of $3.38 per gallon for 2024, a stark drop from previous years. This prediction is rooted in the US\u2019s growing position as an energy superpower, anticipated to exceed historical oil production records. However, several risk factors could counteract this decrease in fuel prices. These include the limited capacity of refineries, potential extreme weather events, and the unpredictable actions of OPEC+, a coalition of oil-producing countries.\n\nGlobal Oil Prices and Fuel Cost Reduction\n\nGlobal oil prices play a significant role in determining domestic fuel prices. A potential 10% decrease in fuel prices due to a slump in global oil prices could have significant implications for consumer spending and the broader economy. However, the volatile nature of the oil market, influenced by geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions, adds a layer of uncertainty to these predictions.\n\nFuel Price Adjustments and Market Strategies\n\nRecent fuel price adjustments shed light on the changing landscape of the oil industry. For instance, Petrobras, Brazil\u2019s state-run oil company, has announced a substantial 8% reduction in diesel prices at its refineries. This move aims to offset the looming end of a federal tax exemption on diesel, which could lead to increased costs for consumers. Such strategies underscore the oil industry\u2019s attempts to adapt to fluctuating market conditions and maintain competitive pricing.\n\nUltimately, the possibility of a significant fuel price cut in 2024 hinges on the sustained stability of crude oil prices and the successful resolution of ongoing crises in key oil-producing regions. The evolving dynamics of the global oil market will continue to shape the trajectory of fuel prices, with potential ramifications for consumers, economies, and the wider energy landscape.",

The data released by the oil ministry indicated that the crude oil processing volume for November stood at 5.29 million metric tonne (MMT), a slight decrease from the 5.31 MMT processed in November of the previous year.Despite this minor dip, the processing from April to November this fiscal year saw an increase, reaching 172.0 MMT, up from 166.7 MMT in the corresponding period last year. The PPAC report also brought to light the total crude oil and condensate production by Indian companies, which marked a rise to 2.61 MMT in November from the 2.54 MMT in the same month last year. The increase was primarily due to higher production from the major state-owned enterprises, ONGC and OIL.Furthermore, the PPAC data indicated that India's reliance on imported crude oil is deepening. The country's self-sufficiency in petroleum products declined to 11.5% in November from 13.1% in the same month a year earlier. Correspondingly, crude oil imports surged to 232.7 MMT in the fiscal year 2022-23 from 212.4 MMT in the previous year, indicating a growing import bill amid efforts to manage inflation.Additionally, the PPAC highlighted the infrastructure of India's major crude oil and product pipeline network as of December 1, 2023. The network comprises pipelines extending 10,938 KM for crude oil and 23,011 KM for products, with the capacities of these pipelines reported to be 153.1 MMTPA for crude and 140.3 MMTPA for products, respectively.",

By doing so, it is a very positive sign, and it looks like we are going to continue to see upward trajectory more than anything else. If we can break above the top of the 50-Day EMA on a daily close, then we could go looking to the $83 level with the 200-Day EMA being a potential target.\n\nUnderneath, the market is likely to continue to see a lot of support, extending down to the $78 level. The $78 level has offered support recently, and therefore if we break down below there, the situation could get kind of ugly, but right now it looks like Brent is trying to do the same thing that the WTI grade of crude oil is going, recovering from a major low.\n\nThe next couple of months will be interesting, but I do think that with the central banks out there looking to loosen monetary policy, specifically the Federal Reserve, it\u2019s likely that we will see people start to bet on an acceleration in the positive momentum for crude oil and other commodities as well. With this, I am cautiously optimistic at the moment but would not be surprised to see multiple pullbacks.\n\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.",
  "19":"Forex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nCrude oil markets experienced a slight retracement in Wednesday's trading session, dipping below short-term support levels before witnessing a resurgence of buyer interest.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude Oil:\n\nThe WTI Crude Oil market initially displayed a minor pullback during Wednesday's trading session, hinting at some negativity. However, the market swiftly saw buyers reentering, aiming to provide support to crude oil prices. This juncture in the crude oil market presents an intriguing scenario, marked by several concurrent factors.\n\nOne noteworthy thing to think about is the timing, as we find ourselves approaching the year's end, a period where liquidity concerns often come to the fore. Simultaneously, market participants are contemplating the possibility of the Federal Reserve implementing a looser monetary policy in 2024. This potential policy shift has led many traders to anticipate increased crude oil demand, given the likely economic expansion driven by enhanced liquidity.\n\nBrent:\n\nSimilarly, Brent crude oil is expected to continue attracting buyers during pullbacks for similar reasons. Wednesday's trading session witnessed this trend in action. Additionally, the presence of the $80 level further reinforces this sentiment, as it represents a significant psychological and round figure in the market.\n\nIt's worth highlighting that both of these crude oil markets recently tested and rebounded sharply from major lows, suggesting the emergence of a market floor. Currently, the preference lies in buying pullbacks in both markets. However, it's essential to acknowledge that this time of year may also feature short-covering activity, limiting the extent of bullish pressure. The inclination to sell crude oil has diminished, and there is a preference for waiting for multi-day pullbacks before initiating longer-term trades extending into 2024.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by the influence of external factors, such as the activities of the Houthis and their attacks on the Red Sea, which significantly impact crude oil shipping. This geopolitical element adds an additional layer of uncertainty to the crude oil market's dynamics.\n\nTL;DR: the crude oil markets are navigating a complex environment characterized by short-term fluctuations and potential long-term opportunities. The interplay between end-of-year liquidity concerns and expectations of looser monetary policy from the Federal Reserve contributes to this dynamic. Buyers are currently active in both WTI and Brent markets, but caution is advised due to the potential for short-covering and external geopolitical influences.\n\nReady to trade our WTI Crude Oil Forex?

  "21":"Nigeria\u2019s 2024 Fiscal Outlook Brightens as Bonny Light Crude Oil Prices Surge\n\nIn what could be a significant boost for Nigeria\u2019s economy, the price of Bonny Light crude oil has surged to $81.11 per barrel.\n\nThis increase of $3.15 above the budget\u2019s reference price of $77.96 comes just before the start of the 2024 fiscal year and could positively impact Nigeria\u2019s N26 trillion budget, which is predicated on a benchmark of $77.96 per barrel and a production volume of 1.78 million barrels per day (bpd).\n\nA Decline in Oil Production\n\nDespite the promising price movement, Nigeria\u2019s oil output has been on the decline. A reported 7.4 percent drop to 1.25 million bpd in November 2023, from 1.35 million bpd in September 2023, poses a risk to achieving the projected revenue, especially if the trend continues into 2024.\n\nIn response to this challenge, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd (NNPCL) has pledged to increase production to two million barrels of crude oil daily starting in 2024. The NNPCL\u2019s Chairman, Pius Akinyelure, has assured the President of the company\u2019s commitment to transforming the oil and gas sector and contributing to the nation\u2019s prosperity.\n\nConfidence in the Future\n\nDespite the current decline, there is optimism for the future. Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, the Minister of State Petroleum Resources, has expressed confidence that oil production will exceed the 2024 budget target. This bullish outlook is grounded in the upward trend in crude oil prices and the commitment of the NNPCL to boost production.\n\nAs the new fiscal year approaches, all eyes will be on Nigeria\u2019s oil sector. Will the increase in crude oil prices and the pledged boost in production translate into a prosperous 2024? Only time will tell.",

The escalation of geopolitical tensions in the region has prompted a reconsideration of earlier expectations.\n\nAccording to industry insiders, the recent surge in crude oil prices, escalating from $73 to $80 per barrel, has injected complications into the previously optimistic outlook.

  "25":"This audio is created with AI assistance\n\nPayment issues have caused delays in shipments of Russian Sokol crude oil to India, forcing Indian Oil Corp (IOC) to purchase more oil from the Middle East, Reuters reported Dec. 26, citing sources close to the matter.\n\nIOC is India's largest refinery, and the only state-owned refinery with an annual contract to buy varieties of Russian grades, including Sokol, from the Russian oil giant Rosneft.\n\nAccording to shipping data, IOC was set to receive six shipments of Sokol from late November to December, but those cargoes were not delivered. One of the tankers, the NS Century, was sanctioned by the U.S. on Nov. 16.\n\nWhile the NS Century is bound for Singapore, the other shipments remain floating off the coasts of India and Sri Lanka.\n\n\"The supplier has an intent to deliver crude oil. Hopefully a solution will be found soon,\" one source told Reuters.\n\nJoin our community\n\nSupport independent journalism in Ukraine. Join us in this fight.\n\nSupport us\n\nIOC has been paying for Russian oil supplies with dirhams, the currency of the United Arab Emirates, since the Indian government advised all its state-owned refineries to switch from Chinese yuan to dirhams.\n\nSources told Reuters that IOC's payments were delayed because Sakhalin-1 LLC, the Rosneft entity that supplies Sokol oil to IOC, has not been able to open a bank account in the UAE that can accept dirham payments.\n\nIndia has become a critical market for Russian oil amid intensifying Western sanctions. It is now the largest buyer of Russian seaborne crude, though sanctions present logistial difficulties in coordinating shipments.\n\nAccording to Reuters, India's oil ministry told a parliamentary panel in December that state oil companies have difficulties paying for Russian oil supplies because some banks cannot process payments for Russian oil in U.S. dollars.\n\nThe ministry also told the panel that India was complying with the G7's price cap of $60 per barrel for seaborne Russian oil.",
  "26":"Russia's Novak Predicts Brent Crude Oil Prices of $80-$85 per Barrel for 2024\n\nIn the previous month, the United States imposed sanctions on Arctic LNG 2, a liquefied natural gas (LNG) initiative spearheaded by the Russian company Novatek (NVTK.MM). In response to the potential repercussions of these sanctions, foreign stakeholders opted to suspend their involvement in the project. This involved relinquishing their obligations for financing and the execution of offtake contracts for the LNG plant, as reported by the Kommersant daily on Monday.\n\nThe impact of the sanctions was further evidenced by Novatek's declaration of force majeure concerning LNG supplies originating from the project. This move by Novatek was a direct consequence of the sanctions imposed on the Arctic LNG 2 project.\n\nDespite these challenges, Russia's Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, remains optimistic about the project's progress. Novak asserted that the first train of the Arctic LNG 2 project has effectively commenced LNG production, with initial deliveries anticipated in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nInsiders within the industry corroborated this information, indicating that the initial production from the train has generated the \"first drops\" of LNG. However, achieving the project's designated capacity of 6.6 million metric tons per year is expected to take some time.\n\nThe sanctions imposed on Arctic LNG 2 reflect the complex geopolitical landscape surrounding energy projects and the involvement of international stakeholders. The decision by foreign shareholders to suspend participation underscores the apprehension and potential economic implications of such punitive measures.\n\nNovatek's invocation of force majeure adds another layer of complexity, emphasizing the challenges faced by the project in meeting its contractual obligations, particularly with regard to LNG supplies.\n\nDespite these setbacks, the initiation of LNG production from the first train marks a notable milestone for the Arctic LNG 2 project. The first quarter of 2024 is anticipated to witness the commencement of deliveries, contributing to Russia's LNG export capabilities.\n\nAs developments unfold, the industry will keenly observe how the project navigates the challenges posed by sanctions and other external factors. The successful realization of Arctic LNG 2 holds significance not only for Novatek but also for Russia's position in the global LNG market. The resilience of the project in the face of geopolitical pressures will likely shape perceptions of Russia's energy capabilities and its ability to navigate complex international energy dynamics.\n\nThe imposition of sanctions on Arctic LNG 2 has prompted a series of challenges, including the suspension of foreign stakeholders' involvement and Novatek's declaration of force majeure. However, with the initiation of LNG production from the first train, the project remains on course, albeit with uncertainties regarding its timeline for reaching full capacity. The unfolding saga of Arctic LNG 2 reflects the intricate interplay between geopolitics and energy projects, showcasing the resilience and adaptability required in the contemporary global energy landscape.",
  "27":"The ongoing crisis in the Red Sea has led to worries about a rise in crude oil prices. However, experts are mostly confident that the spike may not be significant given the US economy has been resilient and China is subdued.\n\nShare Market Live NSE\n\nEd Yardeni, President at Yardeni Research, expects crude oil prices to hover in the $90-$95 per barrel range.\n\n\"On the one hand, we have the US economic outlook looking good and on the other hand, China remains depressed. So, I don\u2019t worry too much about crude oil going up to $100,\u201d he told CNBC-TV18.\n\nThe recent tension in the Middle East has contributed to the increase in oil prices, with a new attack on shipping in the Red Sea causing vessels to avoid the vital shipping route. Global benchmark Brent traded near $81 a barrel after a 2.5% rise on Tuesday, while West Texas Intermediate surpassed $75. The attack on the vessel MSC United VIII occurred on its way to Pakistan from Saudi Arabia, despite efforts by the US and other nations to form a maritime task force to prevent such incidents.\n\nAlso Read\n\nThe Houthi militants based in Yemen are behind the latest attack, adding to the concerns already raised by US strikes on targets in Iraq. These events signal that the Israel-Hamas conflict could potentially escalate into a broader conflict, posing a threat to stability in the Middle East.

  "28":"Charts of crude-oil futures have just flashed a bearish signal the likes of which hasn\u2019t been seen since just before the plunge that preceded the demand destruction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020.\n\nA bearish \u201cdeath cross\u201d pattern appeared Tuesday, with the 50-day moving average for crude futures CL.1, -1.48% CL00, -1.48% crossing below the 200-DMA.\n\nThe 50-DMA is a widely followed short-term trend tracker, while many view the 200-DMA as a dividing line between longer-term uptrends and downtrends. So a death cross is seen by many Wall Street chart watchers as marking the spot that a shorter-term pullback transforms into to a longer-term downtrend.\n\nRead: Dow sees first bearish \u2018death cross\u2019 since March 2022. Here is what typically happens next.\n\nThe death cross comes as crude futures rose 3.1% on Tuesday but have tumbled 16.1% over the past three months.\n\nThe last time crude futures\u2019 50-DMA fell below the 200-DMA was Sept. 7, 2022, when continuous crude futures closed at $81.94. While prices eventually fell, they actually rallied over the next couple of months, to close 12% higher at $91.79 on Nov. 7, 2022.\n\nBut there are some chart watchers, such as Fairlead Strategies LLC technical analyst Katie Stockton, who wouldn\u2019t consider that crossover a real death cross, since the 200-DMA was rising when it appeared.\n\nIn September 2022, a crude-oil death cross appeared with 200-DMA rising, and prices rallied for the next two months before turning lower. FactSet, MarketWatch\n\nThe 50-DMA had dropped to $95.107 on Sept. 7 from $95.659 on Sept. 6, according to FactSet data, while the 200-DMA rose to $95.60 from $95.58.\n\nThe death cross that appeared Tuesday, however, comes with the 50-DMA falling to $77.456 from $77.739 and the 200-DMA slipping to $77.647 from $77.663.\n\nThe last time a real death cross appeared was Feb. 25, 2020, when the 50-DMA declined to $56.377 from $56.554 the day before, and the 200-DMA edged down to $56.396 from $56.455. Crude futures closed that day at $49.90.\n\nAbout three weeks later, when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, crude was 34% lower at $32.98. And two months after the death cross, crude closed 74% lower at $12.78, as the pandemic led to concerns over an overflow of supply coupled with a plunge in demand.\n\nIn 2020, a death cross preceded a big plunge as the COVID-19 pandemic fueled demand-destruction fears. FactSet, MarketWatch\n\nMoving-average crossovers aren\u2019t meant to be good market-timing signals, given that they are well telegraphed. They can, however, provide some historical perspective on how long and how far a current trend has traveled.\n\nFor example, Tuesday\u2019s crossover comes at a time when fundamentals may appear rather bullish. As Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said in a note to clients Tuesday, \u201cbulls have all the reasons on earth\u201d to push crude prices higher, including an intensifying and apparent expansion of violence in the Middle East, production restrictions and expectations that central banks may soon start trying to boost economic growth by lowering interest rates.\n\n\u201cBut interestingly, none has been enough to strengthen the back of the bulls,\u201d Ozkardeskaya wrote.\n\nIn November, after prices fell below the 200-DMA, bulls tried a number of times to reclaim control by getting back above that line but failed to do so. That suggested bears already had the technical momentum on their side.\n\nWhen prices and widely followed fundamentals have apparently contradicted each other in the past, it tends to be prices that prove prescient. In the case of crude, while many may be focusing on potential supply disruptions to be bullish, the real underlying issue driving prices may be concerns over future demand amid slowing economic growth, as the 2020 death cross predicted.\n\nIf crude prices don\u2019t start making some technical progress soon, Ozkardeskaya believes a drop below the $70-per-barrel mark could be on the horizon.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, there will be even more reason to be confident about a series of [Federal Reserve] rate cuts next year,\u201d Ozkardeskaya wrote.",

Upstream oil explorers including Oil India and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will be the key beneficiaries of low crude oil prices.\n\n\u2018\u2019Optimism on OMCs will be contingent on crude sustaining below ~$80\/bbl with OMCs\u2019 FY24 P\/B valuations (at ~0.9x for HPCL\/IOCL and 1.1x for BPCL) being only 10 per cent discount to historical average after recent rally,'' said JM Financials.\n\nOMC stocks today\n\nOn Thursday, shares of IOC opened at \u20b9127.25 and gained 5.26 per cent to hit a 52-week high mark of \u20b9133.95 against a previous close of \u20b9126.70 apiece on the BSE.

  "30":"Brent crude oil price news: Oil prices rose in early Asian trade on Thursday as persistent fears over escalating tensions in the Middle East outweighed easing concerns about transport disruptions as some global shipping firms said they were returning to the Red Sea route.\n\nBrent crude futures climbed 20 cents, or 0.3 per cent, to $79.85 a barrel by 0133 GMT. US WTI crude futures were up 24 cents, or 0.3 per cent, at $74.35 a barrel.\n\nPrices dropped nearly 2 per cent on Wednesday as major shipping firms began returning to the Red Sea.\n\n\"Concerns about shipping in the Red Sea have eased, but continued worries about tensions in the Middle East, especially on Iran's involvement in the region, make it difficult to sell further,\" said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, president of NS Trading, a unit of Nissan Securities.\n\n\"The market is likely to try the upside again... maybe in the early new year, also on expectations of a recovery in fuel demand thanks to monetary easing in the United States and higher kerosene demand during the winter in northern hemisphere,\" he said.\n\nDanish shipping company Maersk said it has scheduled several dozen container vessels to travel via the Suez Canal and Red Sea in the coming weeks after calling a temporary halt to those routes this month after attacks by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi militia.\n\nBut the prospect of a prolonged Israeli military campaign in Gaza and the spillover of the conflict to attacks on ships in the Red Sea remain major drivers of market sentiment.\n\nIsraeli forces pummelled central Gaza by land, sea and air on Wednesday, a day after Israel's chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, told reporters the war would go on \"for many months\".\n\nGrowing expectations that key central banks such as the Federal Reserve will start to cut interest rates early next year also lent support. Lower interest rates reduce borrowing costs, which can stimulate both economic growth and oil demand.\n\nThe market showed little reaction to the build in US crude stockpiles last week.\n\nUS oil inventories rose by 1.84 million barrels in the week to Dec. 22, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Wednesday, against an estimated drop of about 2.7 million barrels in a poll of seven analysts by Reuters.\n\nUS government data on stockpiles is due on Thursday, delayed by a day due to the Christmas holiday on Monday",
  "31":"The recent easing of sanctions between the United States and Venezuela, marked by pivotal legal settlements and new commercial arrangements, represents a significant turning point for the global energy industry.\n\nThese developments, particularly the resolution of disputes involving Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), signal the reinvigoration of Venezuela's oil and gas sector and hold substantial promise for energy-hungry Europe.\n\nThe settlement between PDVSA and Refineria di K\u00f2rsou (RdK), navigated by Dentons Europe LLP - led by David Syed, head of their Sovereign Advisory practice - brings to an end a longstanding impasse that had stifled the operational potential of RdK's refinery and oil terminal in Cura\u00e7ao since 2020.\n\nUnder this settlement, PDVSA will resume the supply of crude oil to RdK and initiate discussions on long-term gas supply, enabling RdK to recommence its operations. This development is a win for PDVSA and RdK and a strategic move that reopens crucial pathways in the Caribbean energy landscape.\n\nFurthermore, the collaboration between PDVSA and Repsol Exploraci\u00f3n, S.A. to bolster investment in their joint venture, Petroquiriquire, S.A., heralds a new era of increased production in the Venezuelan oil and gas industry.\n\nA similar deal with ENI of Italy is imminently expected.\n\nThe intention to significantly boost overall production underlines a commitment to revitalize the national economy of Venezuela, a country with one of the world's largest oil reserves but whose potential has been largely untapped due to political and economic challenges.\n\nFor Europe, these developments couldn't be timelier. The continent benefits greatly, grappling with energy supply concerns exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and a push for diversification away from reliance on Russian energy sources.\n\nVenezuela's re-entry into the global oil and gas market as a significant player provides Europe with an alternative and potentially stable energy source. This could be instrumental in mitigating the current energy crisis and contributing to Europe's energy security.\n\nVenezuela's strategic geographic location and colossal oil reserves make it an ideal candidate for European nations striving to diversify their energy sources. Venezuela boasts the world's largest proven oil reserves, exceeding even those of Saudi Arabia.\n\nAccording to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Venezuela's proven oil reserves are estimated to be around 303.8 billion barrels, representing a significant portion of the global oil supply.\n\nBefore the sanctions and economic turmoil, Venezuela was producing about 2.4 million barrels per day. Though current production levels are significantly lower, there is potential for rapid growth given the country's abundant reserves.\n\nOil output has already increased significantly over the last year under the leadership of Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez and Oil Minister Pedro Rafael Tellechea.\n\nAs of 2021, the European Union's crude oil imports from Russia accounted for roughly 27% of its total oil imports, according to Eurostat. Replacing even a fraction of this with Venezuelan oil could significantly enhance Europe's energy security.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMoreover, Venezuela's location is advantageous for transatlantic trade. Its proximity to the Caribbean Sea provides direct maritime routes to European ports, potentially making oil and gas transportation more efficient and cost-effective compared to other global suppliers.\n\nIn essence, the sanctions relief deal and the subsequent legal and commercial maneuvers represent a recalibration of the global energy equation. For Venezuela, it marks a resurgence of its energy sector and a step towards economic recovery. For Europe, it offers a new avenue for securing energy resources, crucial for its economic stability and energy independence.\n\nBy\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",

  "34":"By Osama Rizvi, economist & energy analyst\n\nThe global oil markets are poised for some serious headwinds and challenges in 2024. Euronews Business looks at the outlook for the most important commodity in the world, oil.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAn impending recession, a deepening slowdown in the major economies of the world, less than expected crude demand from China, and less production will be defining features for oil markets in 2024.\n\nFirstly, let\u2019s recap the performance of crude oil in 2023.\n\nOil markets in 2023 - a recap\n\nThe oil markets in 2023 can be defined by certain characteristics. The most important of all was the prolonged production cuts by OPEC+ (the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies). Together they pump 40% of global oil supply.\n\nIn April 2023, the group announced additional cuts of 1.65 million barrels per day (mbpd), building on their previously agreed cuts of 2 mbpd from October 2022. This would correspond to about 3.66 mbpd of cuts equal to about 3% of global oil demand. Markets reacted positively to this development and oil prices rallied.\n\nThe trend gained more momentum when in June 2023 Saudi Arabia, the de-facto leader of OPEC and one of the top 3 largest oil producers in the world, decided to volunteer for additional cuts of 1 mbpd \u201cwith the aim of supporting the stability and balance of oil markets\u201d. Oil prices peaked at $97, an increase of 25% since June 2023. Recently in November, OPEC+ also agreed to extend the cuts into the first quarter of 2024.\n\nApart from that, China\u2019s economic recovery continued to thwart any sustainable and substantial oil price rally. European countries also registered an economic slowdown with oil demand in Germany falling by 90,000 bpd in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) expectations. Furthermore, US manufacturing activity declined for 13 consecutive months.\n\nThe war in the Middle-East, meanwhile, had a muted effect on oil prices.\n\nOil price outlook for 2024\n\nIt is expected that we will see ample supply next year due to a slowdown in economic activity combined with rising production from the US - that recently touched its highest at 13.24 mbpd. Moreover, Brazil, Guyana, Norway and Canada will keep the markets flush with enough oil. This also answers the question of whether oil prices will touch $100 in 2024. Without a geopolitical flashpoint, the chances of that happening are almost zero.\n\nThe IEA sees global oil demand rising next year as it highlighted in its recent report. It said that the world\u2019s oil consumption will increase by 1.1 mbpd in 2024 - and noted production from non-OPEC producers will also contribute 1.2 mbpd to global supply. OPEC\u2019s 2024 outlook is slightly different from that of the IEA as it sees an uptick of 2.25 mbpd.\n\nIn terms of price, technical analysis shows there seems to be considerable support at $65 (for WTI) and in the mid $60 range for Brent crude, if the global recession hits. Realising the slowdown in the global economy, Goldman Sachs has reduced its forecast as it sees Brent averaging $80\/$81. This forecast converges with that of IEA, which sees Brent at $82.57 per barrel in 2024. Barclays is still on the higher side and sees oil averaging $93 in 2024, while S&P Global thinks $85 is more appropriate.\n\nThe most important trend to follow in order to get a better understanding on the outlook for oil prices for 2024 is the state of the global economy as oil demand is synonymous with economic activity.\n\nWhen OPEC+ reduced its output (as earlier noted) it was not because there was more oil in the markets, it was because the group was wise enough to foresee the impending slowdown in the global economy.\n\nAs we enter 2024, the global economic indicators do not look very strong and the probability of a recession, despite suggestions of a soft landing, is still high. As a result, oil prices in 2024 will have more downside potential than upside.\n\nHow market oil prices impact consumers\n\nCrude oil is the most strategically important commodity in the world. There are 4000+ by-products of oil and its price impacts almost all the sectors of the economy and every sphere of our lives.\n\nRising oil prices contribute to higher transportation costs that can result in the increased prices of goods. Furthermore, by driving up energy prices in general, rising oil prices contribute to higher inflation levels that eat away at consumers\u2019 purchasing power.\n\nAccording to Eurosystem staff projections \u201can increase of 1% in oil prices would imply a decline in the level of euro area potential output of around -0.02% in the medium term\u201d.\n\nDespite the headwinds in 2024, consumers might be able to breathe a sigh of relief as oil prices are expected to remain range-bound or trend downwards as compared to 2023, as earlier noted, with the global economy expected to remain sluggish.",

This agreement further strengthens QatarEnergy\u2019s relationship with Shell, which is not only a reliable crude oil off-taker, but also a major customer and a strategic partner of QatarEnergy,\u201d His Excellency Mr. Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi, the Minister of State for Energy Affairs and the President and CEO of QatarEnergy, said.\n\nThe value of the deal was not disclosed.\n\nThis strategic move is driven by QatarEnergy\u2019s strategy to forge enduring and strategic business relationships.\n\nThis deal represents a pragmatic acknowledgment that, despite the global push towards cleaner energy alternatives, the demand for conventional fossil fuels persists. That being said, it can be viewed as a transitional measure, providing stability for both entities while allowing them to collectively navigate the complex journey towards a more sustainable energy future.\n\nThe collaboration between QatarEnergy and Shell extends well beyond this landmark agreement, reflecting a history of joint investments in the energy sector within Qatar and across the globe. Notable ventures include contributions to QatarEnergy LNG projects, the Pearl GTL Plant, and various other investments.\n\nSpecifically, in October 2023, QatarEnergy and Shell, through their affiliates, signed two long-term LNG sale and purchase agreements for the supply of LNG from Qatar to the Netherlands.\n\nPursuant to the agreements, up to 3.5 million tons per annum (mtpa) of LNG will be delivered to the Gate LNG terminal in the port of Rotterdam starting in 2026 for a term of 27 years.\n\nRelated Article Posted: 2 months ago QatarEnergy and Shell agree on 27-year LNG supply to the Netherlands Posted: 2 months ago\n\nMoreover, in November, QatarEnergy signed a partnership agreement with China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec) for the North Field South (NFS) expansion project.\n\nThe two parties signed a long-term sales and purchase agreement (SPA) for the delivery of 3 million tons per annum (MTPA) of LNG from the NFS project to Sinopec\u2019s receiving terminals in China over a span of 27 years.",

  "41":"Crude oil posted the biggest weekly gain since October as attacks in the Red Sea forced hundreds of ships to take safer but longer routes, delaying the delivery of oil cargoes. Oil prices also eased expectations Angola could increase oil output after leaving the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cartel, but rose for the week on positive US economic news and worries Houthi ship attacks would boost supply costs.\n\nBrent futures fell 32 cents, or 0.4 per cent, to settle at $79.07 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 33 cents, or 0.5 per cent, to settle at $73.56, according to news agency Reuters. This left both benchmarks up about three per cent for the week after gaining less than one per cent last week.\n\nAlso Read: Year 2023 | From $82 to near $100 and back: How Brent crude moved in 2023 over OPEC+ cuts and more\n\nBack home, on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), crude oil futures due for a January 19 expiry, settled higher by 0.02 per cent at \u20b96,164 per bbl, having swung between \u20b96,126 and \u20b96,247 per bbl during the session, against a previous close of \u20b96,163 per barrel.\n\nWhat's driving crude oil prices?\n\n-Crude is headed for its first annual drop since 2020 as surging production from the US and elsewhere counters efforts by the OPEC cartel to support prices through output cuts. The outlook for demand is also fragile, with the International Energy Agency forecasting that growth will slow sharply next year.\n\n-So far this week, only about 30 tankers, including crude oil and fuel carriers, have entered the Bab al-Mandab Strait at the southern end of the Red Sea, according to vessel-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n-In the Middle East, more maritime carriers said they were avoiding the Red Sea due to attacks on vessels carried out by the Iranian-backed Houthi militant group, which says it is responding to Israel's war in Gaza. Major shippers such as Maersk said they would impose extra charges linked to re-routing ships.\n\nAlso Read: Angola's OPEC exit opens way for more Chinese investment\n\n-The attacks have caused disruptions through the Suez Canal, which handles about 12 per cent of world trade. In Iraq, oil ministry spokesman Asim Jihad affirmed Iraq's support for the OPEC agreement and its commitment to voluntary oil cuts.\n\n-In Africa, Angola's decision to leave the OPEC cartel could open the way for Beijing to increase investment in the country's oil and other sectors. Angola produces about 1.1 million barrels per day of oil.\n\n-The US inflation data and Houthi attacks in the Red Sea should be more supportive of oil prices than any future increase in output from Angola, according to analysts.\n\n-In the US, a key inflation reading came in softer than expected, boosting investor optimism that the US Federal Reserve would lower borrowing costs next year. Lower interest rates cut consumer borrowing costs, which can boost economic growth and demand for oil.\n\n-Expectations that the Fed is more likely to cut interest rates next year also helped reduce the US dollar to its lowest since July against a basket of other currencies for a second day in a row. A weaker dollar can boost oil demand by making the fuel more expensive for buyers using other currencies.\n\nMilestone Alert!

US West Texas Intermediate crude fell 67 cents, or 0.9 per cent, to $74.90, according to news agency Reuters. Both the Brent and WTI benchmarks settled more than 2 per cent higher in the previous session as the latest attacks on ships in the Red Sea prompted fears of shipping disruption.\n\nBack home, on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), crude oil futures due for a January 19 expiry, was last trading 1.63 per cent lower at \u20b96,212 per bbl, having swung between \u20b96,193 and \u20b96,314 per bbl during the session, against a previous close of \u20b96,315 per barrel.\n\nWhat's weighing on crude oil prices?\n\n-Danish shipping company Maersk said it has scheduled several dozen container vessels to travel via the Suez Canal and Red Sea in the coming weeks after calling a temporary halt to those routes this month after attacks by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi militia.\n\n-The prospect of a prolonged Israeli military campaign in Gaza remained a major driver of market sentiment.

The surge in crude oil prices was further fuelled by a weakening dollar index, which hit a five-month low due to growing optimism about imminent interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve. US actively contributed to the bullish trend by initiating purchases for its strategic reserves, lending additional support to prices.\n\n\u2018\u2019Anticipating ongoing volatility, we project that crude oil prices will exhibit fluctuations.

  "45":"At the end of the day, the recent rally in the crude oil market signifies bullish sentiment, with key technical levels playing a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nThe crude oil market staged a remarkable rally during Tuesday's trading session, underscoring the presence of substantial bullish pressure as it looks like Federal Reserve policy is starting to take center stage here.\n\nWTI Crude Oil\n\nIn West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil, prices surged significantly, breaching the crucial $75 level. This level, marked by its psychological significance and round-figure status, succumbed to the market's upward momentum. Notably, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average lies just above, potentially acting as a resistance point in the near term. Therefore, traders should remain mindful of this technical factor.\n\nA potential breakthrough of the 50-day EMA could propel the market toward the 200-day EMA, a pivotal trend-defining point for many traders. Beneath the current price action, the $73 level persists as a formidable support zone, having recently facilitated a strong bounce. This development suggests the potential for a shift in the prevailing trend.\n\nBrent\n\nThe Brent markets similarly experienced a substantial rally, with prices testing the 50-day EMA and surmounting the $80 level. This upward move represents a positive signal, affirming the likelihood of continued upward momentum. A daily close above the top of the 50-day EMA could set the stage for an advance toward the $83 level, with the 200-day EMA emerging as a potential target.\n\nBeneath the current price structure, robust support is anticipated, extending down to the $78 level. Recent price action has demonstrated the resilience of this level as a support base. However, a breach below this level could introduce a measure of uncertainty into the market, although at present, Brent seems to be mirroring the recovery pattern observed in WTI Crude Oil after a significant low.\n\nLooking ahead, the upcoming months are poised to be intriguing, with central banks, including the Federal Reserve, contemplating a loosening of monetary policy. This potential shift in monetary dynamics could stimulate positive momentum for crude oil and other commodities. Consequently, there is a sense of cautious optimism prevailing, but it is prudent to remain prepared for potential pullbacks in the market.\n\nAt the end of the day, the recent rally in the crude oil market signifies bullish sentiment, with key technical levels playing a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory. Market participants must stay attuned to these levels while keeping an eye on evolving central bank policies, which could significantly influence the direction of crude oil and the broader commodity landscape. While optimism prevails, traders should remain vigilant for any potential retracements soon.\n\nReady to trade WTI Crude Oil FX?

  "46":"The first thing that catches my attention is the fact that we are at the end of the year and liquidity probably continues to be an issue. That being said, we also have to keep in mind that if the Federal Reserve is in fact going to loosen monetary policy in 2024, a lot of traders extrapolate that out to the idea of more crude oil demand as it is likely we will continue to see economic expansion based on liquidity.\n\nBrent Crude Oil Technical Analysis\n\nFor many of the same reasons, I think that Brent is also going to continue to see buyers on dips. We have certainly seen that play out during the day on Wednesday, and of course the fact that the $80 level is right here as well certainly makes a certain amount of sense as it is a large, round, psychologically significant figure.\n\nIt is probably worth noting that both of these markets have recently tested a major low and bounced quite sharply, so I do think that we have found a floor in the market. I presently like the idea of buying pullbacks in both markets, but I also recognize this time of year could also feature a certain amount of short covering, so you can only read so much into the bullish pressure. I have no interest in selling oil anymore, but I would like to see some type of multi-day pullback in order to get involved in what I think is going to be a longer-term trade for a significant part of the year going into 2024. This is especially exacerbated by the Houthis and their attacks on the Red Sea, which obviously has a major influence on shipping of crude oil.\n\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.",

  "50":"Just a week back, the government slashed windfall tax on crude oil from \u20b95,000 per tonne to \u20b91,300 per tonne. The move is meant to help Indian refiners export fuels to tap high-return markets. But going forward, any spike in global crude prices will force the government to reintroduce similar curbs to maintain price stability in the Indian market. In FY23, India spent $157.5 billion on importing 232.7 million tonnes of crude oil.\n\nThe government imposed the windfall tax on crude oil producers and extended the levy on export of fuels in July 2022 to increase fuel availability in the domestic market as it would reduce the prices. It was also the time that Indian refiners were getting Russian crude at a discounted price of up to 20%, due to U.S. sanctions on Russia post its war in Ukraine.\n\nGlobal geopolitical events have serious impact on crude prices and India is at the receiving end as the second largest crude importer after China. When the OPEC+ members cut crude production to jack up prices a year back, Indian government increased the import of discounted Russian crude to keep petroleum prices low in the country. Russian oil share in India\u2019s import basket jumped to around 25% from just 1% because of the deep discount of around $15-20 a barrel.",
  "51":"On December 15, Guyana and Venezuela agreed to resolve the Essequibo dispute without the use of force. With that, the threat of a military conflict is over - at least for now.\n\nEsequibo is a part of English-speaking Guyana, constituting two-thirds of the total land. However the densely-forested region has been claimed by Venezuela for the last two centuries.\n\nThe territorial dispute took a dramatic turn on May 20, 2015, when US energy giant ExxonMobil announced that it had discovered crude oil deposits in the region.\n\n\"In 2013, the Guyanese explored the waters off the Essequibo coast for oil reserves and awarded a license to ExxonMobil to drill for oil. Without this oil discovery, the dispute would not have escalated to the current level,\" argues Latin America expert Hari Seshashayee.\n\nThe offshore waters of Essequibo hold over 11.2 billion oil-equivalent barrels and 17 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves.\n\nThe discovery, nevertheless, opened Guyana's door to economic prosperity.\n\nUntil 2019, when commercial oil exploration began, Guyana's economy depended on agriculture and mining. But the discovery of oil & natural gas has helped change the economy, as they now constitute nearly half of the country's Gross Domestic Product.\n\nThe country has been the fastest growing economy since 2020, even as the global economy slowed under the weight of Covid-19 lockdowns and the Ukraine war.\n\nIn 2022, Guyana's economy grew by a whopping 62.3 per cent. The Caribbean country is expected to end 2023 with a growth rate of over 38 per cent. The momentum is likely to continue in 2024 too, with the economy expected to grow at an average of 20 per cent.\n\nGuyana's oil and gas reserves are expected to potentially alter the global energy panorama.\n\nAs per some estimates, the South American country is set to become a top per capita oil producer by 2030. Thanks to its new-found oil wealth, Guyana now ranks high in GDP per capita in the Americas. Some estimates also suggest that the oil reserves can also help the country of 800,000 people to become richer than Kuwait or the UAE.\n\nThe dispute, however, imparts some lessons about the close link between politics and economics.\n\nSeshasayee blames the current escalation on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro who, he argues, is fueling the dispute to appease his domestic constituency. \"Maduro is essentially making a storm in a teacup. This will likely amount to nothing,\" he says.\n\nIn fact, Maduro held a referendum in November over the question of annexing Essequibo, which was marred by poor voter turnout and allegations of irregularities. Interestingly, the referendum took place just days after Guyana discovered another oil reserve in the region.\n\nThe fears of a military confrontation are not new. Reports suggest that Venezuela was eyeing the region during the Falkland war between the UK and Argentina.\n\nHowever, the discovery of fossil fuels immediately triggered fears of a military confrontation in Guyana. \"Guyana at the moment is facing a challenge to its survival by a larger state,\" President David Granger said in 2015.\n\nVenezuela already is a top oil producer and is known to possess the largest-proven oil reserves in the world.\n\nExperts argue that adding Guyana's proven oil reserves in its kitty is unlikely to make much of a difference. So, the general view is that this issue has been whipped up only to save Maduro's presidency, due for expiry next year.\n\nNevertheless, the timing of the escalation underlines the difference that natural resources can make to the economic and political importance of a region.\n\nThe Arabian peninsula is a prime example. Once an arid and resource-scarce region, the discovery of oil in the late 1930s tranformed Saudi Arabia - the kingdom occupies most of the peninsula - into a geopolitical hub, where the superpowers vie for influence.\n\nThanks to Essequibo, Guyana has the opportunity to turn its oil reserves into 'black gold'. But the looming fear of a Venezuelan invasion and other uncertainties could force Guyana to never achieve its full economic potential.",
  "52":"Oil jumped over two per cent on Tuesday, December 26, to the highest in almost a month, supported by Middle East strife and investor optimism that the US Federal Reserve would soon start cutting interest rates, boosting global economic growth and fuel demand.\n\nThe rally - in thin trade with some markets closed for public holidays, added to last week's gains of about three per cent after Houthi attacks on ships disrupted global shipping and trade while the Israel-Hamas conflict shows no sign of easing.\n\nBrent crude futures were up by $1.79, or 2.3 per cent, at $80.86 a barrel and earlier reached $81.23, the highest since December 1. US West Texas Intermediate crude rose by $1.89, or 2.6 per cent, to $75.45, according to news agency Reuters.\n\nAlso Read: India's crude oil output down 0.4% to 2.4 MMT in November, imports decrease 2.3% YoY: PPAC\n\nBack home, on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), crude oil futures due for a January 19 expiry, was last trading 2.53 per cent lower at \u20b96,319 per bbl, having swung between \u20b96,101 and \u20b96,322 per bbl during the session, against a previous close of \u20b96,163 per barrel.\n\nWhat's driving crude oil prices?\n\n-Despite concern about the Middle East and the re-routing of ships, actual supply has not yet been affected. Maersk on Sunday announced the restart of shipping routes through the Red Sea, easing the concerns to some extent. Analysts said that the lack of oil supply disruptions is offsetting the support to prices from ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.\n\n-Shipping companies had stopped sending vessels through the Red Sea and imposed surcharges for re-routing ships. The Red Sea connects with the Suez Canal, a major shipping route used for about 12 per cent of global trade. Germany's Hapag-Lloyd will decide on Wednesday how it will proceed with its Red Sea routes after suspending shipments there, according to Reuters.\n\n-Two explosions in the Red Sea were reported by a vessel sailing off the coast of Yemen on Tuesday shortly after two unmanned aircraft were sighted. Oil also found support from expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates next year. Lower interest rates cut consumer borrowing costs, which can boost economic growth and oil demand.\n\n-Oil prices also eased last week over expectations Angola could increase oil output after leaving the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cartel. Crude is headed for its first annual drop since 2020 as surging production from the US and elsewhere counters efforts by the OPEC cartel to support prices through output cuts\n\n-An Israeli minister hinted on Tuesday that the country had retaliated in Iraq, Yemen and Iran for attacks carried out against it as the war with Hamas-led Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip widens to other areas of the region.\n\nWhere are prices headed?\n\nAnalysts said that crude oil exhibited notable volatility, marking its second consecutive week of gains in the international markets. Although there was some profit-taking observed on Friday, the commodity closed the week with a net gain.\n\nThe prevailing tensions in the Red Sea counteracted the impact of Angola's departure from the OPEC nations, noted market experts. Additionally, last week's release of US economic data surpassed expectations, providing further support to oil prices.\n\nThe weakening dollar index and US bond yields also contributed to the favourable conditions for oil prices. The increase in US crude oil inventories during the past week acted as a limiting factor on gains, with inventories surging by 2.9 million barrels, imposing a cap on potential upside movements.\n\n\u2018\u2019Anticipating ongoing volatility, we project crude oil prices to remain dynamic. Support levels for crude oil are identified at $73.10\u201372.30, with resistance levels at $74.50-75.10 for the current session. In terms of INR, crude oil finds support at \u20b96,070-5,960, while encountering resistance at \u20b96,240-6,320,'' said Rahul Kalantri, VP Commodities, Mehta Equities Ltd.\n\nMilestone Alert!

  "58":"Norsk versjon.\n\nWith the onset of the summer navigation season on the Northern Sea Route (NSR), Russia has begun sending crude oil shipments to China via the Arctic. After an initial trial voyage in November 2022, energy analysts expect Russia to send regular shipments through the Arctic during 2023 and beyond.\n\nWith Europe completely out of the picture as a result of sanctions, Russia now diverts parts of its Arctic production to China. Additional shipments are destined for India.\n\nTwo initial shipments departed from the Primorsk and Ust-Luga oil terminals near St Petersburg on 12 July and 13 July, passing through the Baltic Sea and up the Norwegian coast lines.\n\nThe two Aframax oil tankers, NS Arctic and Primorsky Prospect, each carrying around 730,000 barrels of crude oil, traveled along the NSR throughout the second half of July and are expected to arrive in Rizhao, China in mid-August.\n\nCompared to the traditional route through the Suez Canal, the Arctic shortcut is around 30 percent faster.

  "65":"U.S. crude oil production has overwhelmingly exceeded earlier forecasts and has grown at a much faster pace this year, offsetting much of the OPEC+ efforts to push up prices by coordinated supply reductions.\n\nU.S. production growth is expected to continue into the new year, thanks to further gains in efficiency and higher spending and production plans by the U.S. supermajors that have just announced megamerger deals.\n\nSome analysts predict that the U.S. oil output increase will slacken in 2024.\n\nBut others, including industry officials, see the estimates of production growth by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) as too conservative for 2024, and believe that U.S. shale production could top projections again.\n\nThe U.S. is now producing more than 13 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil\u2014more than any country ever\u2014and is headed to a continued increase in the short and medium term.\n\nU.S. crude oil production hit a new monthly record of 13.236 million bpd in September, according to the latest available data from the EIA.

We're seeing many shale basins that were flattish experiencing a revival,\" Francisco Blanch, Head of Global Commodities and Derivatives Research at BofA, said on a call to discuss the bank's energy outlook, as quoted by Reuters.\n\nSoaring production is also leading to surging exports of U.S. crude oil and petroleum products.\n\nThis year, U.S. crude oil production is set to average 12.93 million bpd and rise further to average 13.11 million bpd next year, the EIA said in its Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) in December.\n\nThe some 200,000-bpd increase projected by the EIA is too conservative, according to Dan Eberhart, chief executive of Canary, a privately owned oilfield services company in the U.S.\n\nEberhart doesn't believe that U.S. oil output growth would be limited to just 250,000 bpd next year.\n\n\"It's more likely that America will keep marching toward an output of 15 million barrels a day before 2026, given the efficiency and productivity gains shale companies are delivering from assets in the flagship Permian Basin, along with smaller shale formations like the Bakken and Eagle Ford, as well as the offshore Gulf of Mexico,\" the executive wrote in Forbes this week.\n\nOPEC itself acknowledged in its latest monthly report that U.S. oil production is soaring.\n\nOPEC noted in its report that \"US crude and condensate production as well as NGL output continue to reach new highs.

  "66":"December 25, 2023 04:07 pm | Updated 04:07 pm IST - New Delhi\n\nIndia's first-ever payment in rupees for crude oil purchased from the UAE is helping the world's third largest energy consumer push for taking the local currency global, as it looks for similar deals with other suppliers, officials said, adding internationalisation is a process and there are no targets.\n\nWith the nation more than 85% dependent on imports for meeting its oil needs, India has been pursuing a three-pronged strategy of buying from the cheapest available source, diversifying sources of supply and not breaching any international obligation like the price cap in case of Russian oil.\n\nWhile the strategy helped save billions of dollars, when it ramped up imports of Russian oil that was shunned by some in West post Ukraine war, it is looking to settle trade in rupees instead of dollars in a bid to cut transaction costs by eliminating dollar conversions.\n\nIndia in July signed an agreement with the UAE for rupee settlement and soon after Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) made payments for purchase of a million barrels of crude oil from Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) in Indian rupees.\n\nSome of the Russian oil imports too have been settled in rupee.\n\nOfficials said the default payment currency for import of crude oil has been the US dollar for several decades and the currency traditionally has liquidity as well as lower hedging cost.\n\nBut to boost the rupee's role in cross-border payments, the Reserve Bank of India allowed more than a dozen banks to settle trades in rupees with 18 countries since last year.\n\nSince then, India has been encouraging big oil exporters such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia to accept the Indian currency for trade settlements, officials said, adding the first success happened in August this year when IOC made the rupee payment to ADNOC.\n\nMore such deals may happen in future, they said, insisting there was no target as internationalisation is a process and cannot happen overnight.\n\n\"We have to be mindful that it (rupee settlement) does not lead to increase in cost and is in no way detrimental to the trade,\" an official said.\n\n\"Settling a trade in rupee where the amount is not big does not pose much problem but when you have each shipload of crude oil costing millions of dollars, there are issues.\" India, they said, is navigating the situation keeping overarching national interest in mind.\n\nThe internationalization of the rupee will help reduce dollar demand and make the Indian economy less vulnerable to global currency shocks.\n\nA parliamentary standing committee report, tabled in Parliament last week, stated that there were not many takers for Indian rupee.\n\nOfficials said that situation was true for 2022-23 fiscal and there has been a rupee trade this year.\n\n\"During FY 2022-23, no crude oil imports by oil PSUs were settled in Indian rupee. Crude oil suppliers (including UAE's ADNOC) continue to express their concern on the repatriation of funds in the preferred currency and also highlighted high transactional costs associated with conversion of funds along with exchange fluctuation risks,\" the ministry told the panel.\n\nThe ministry, whose subimissions are part of the committee's report which was tabled in Parliament last week, said India Oil Corporation (IOC) has informed that it incurred high transaction costs as crude oil suppliers pass on the additional transactional costs to IOC.\"",

  "68":"Crude Oil Sees Nearly 2% Decline Amidst Investor Attention to Red Sea Developments\n\nWednesday witnessed a notable downturn in oil prices, marked by a substantial 2% decrease that effectively erased the gains recorded in the preceding day's trading. This shift in market dynamics was predominantly instigated by investors closely monitoring unfolding events in the Red Sea. Despite the persisting attacks in the region on Tuesday, shipping companies exhibited a resumption of their operations, adding complexity to an already intricate geopolitical scenario.\n\nThe settlement for Brent crude futures notably dwindled by $1.42, reflecting a 1.8% decline and concluding at $79.65 per barrel. Concurrently, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude experienced a drop of $1.46, equivalent to a 1.9% decrease, and settled at $74.11. These price adjustments signaled a notable response to the evolving geopolitical landscape, underlining the inherent volatility and sensitivity of the oil market to geopolitical developments.\n\nA significant development in this scenario came with the announcement from Danish shipping conglomerate Maersk, revealing plans to schedule several dozen container vessels to traverse the Suez Canal and Red Sea over the upcoming weeks. This strategic decision follows a brief suspension of operations in these routes earlier in the month due to attacks by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi militia. In alignment with Maersk's initiative, France's CMA CGM confirmed the resumption of its passage through the Red Sea. This strategic move aligns with the deployment of a multinational task force to the region, aiming to secure and stabilize shipping routes in the face of escalating threats.\n\nThe multifaceted nature of these developments prompted Callum Macpherson, Head of Commodities at Investec, to emphasize the necessity of assessing whether increased naval patrols and the modification of shipping routes would effectively lead to a decrease in attacks. This underscores the strategic and risk-assessment considerations that market participants and authorities need to factor into their decision-making processes.\n\nIn the prior trading session, both the Brent and WTI benchmarks had demonstrated an increase of over 2%. The recent attacks on ships navigating the Red Sea had heightened concerns regarding potential disruptions to shipping, casting a shadow of uncertainty over global energy markets. Adding to the complexity, the ongoing Israeli military campaign in Gaza emerged as a significant influence shaping market sentiment. Israeli forces intensified their operations on multiple fronts, contributing to the broader geopolitical landscape and affecting perceptions of stability in the region.\n\nFurther complicating the situation, oil loadings at the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiisk experienced a temporary suspension due to adverse weather conditions. However, it's noteworthy that despite this interruption, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) terminal situated near the port remained operational, as confirmed by Kazakhstan's energy ministry. This nuanced development showcases the intricate balance of factors influencing oil supply chains, ranging from geopolitical tensions to weather-related disruptions.\n\nThe global oil market is a complex ecosystem influenced by a delicate interplay of factors, including geopolitical tensions, weather-related disruptions, and inventory data. The recent dip in oil prices serves as a vivid illustration of the market's heightened sensitivity to these variables. Investors and industry participants are compelled to closely monitor these dynamic developments and exercise adaptability to navigate the multifaceted influences that shape commodity prices.\n\nThe oil market's recent volatility, spurred by events in the Red Sea, underscores the imperative for stakeholders to remain vigilant and responsive to geopolitical shifts and other factors influencing supply and demand dynamics. The confluence of shipping disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and weather-related interruptions amplifies the challenges faced by market participants, necessitating a comprehensive and adaptive approach to navigate these uncertainties in the global energy landscape.",

Over the last 12 months, MODEC was responsible for the topside integration and shipyard pre-commissioning work undertaken in Singapore.\n\n\u201cThis has been a demanding project in terms of both technical and execution complexity. The challenges were compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, but we remained fully committed to safety and quality throughout the entire process, achieving over 21 million exposure hours without a lost time injury (LTI). Through teamwork among all stakeholders, and everyone\u2019s dedication and hard work, we are proud to deliver an FPSO that will be a safe place to work for all,\u201d said Soichi Ide, President and CEO of MODEC Offshore Production Systems (Singapore).\n\nMoored in waters approximately 780 meters deep, the FPSO will be capable of processing 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day, 145,000 barrels of water injection per day, and will have a minimum storage capacity of 1.3 million barrels of crude oil.\n\n\u201cWe are targeting first oil from Sangomar in mid-2024. The FPSO sail away reaffirms Woodside\u2019s commitment to Senegal and its future development and prosperity. Sangomar is Senegal\u2019s first offshore oil development and we remain committed to working with the Government of Senegal and local communities to ensure that the benefits from our investments are felt broadly across the country,\u201d said Woodside CEO Meg O\u2019Neill.\n\n\u201cThe successful and safe departure of the FPSO could not have been achieved without our strong relationship with PETROSEN and our contractors MODEC and Seatrium. Achieving this milestone having achieved 21 million exposure hours work on the FPSO without a lost time injury is an outstanding result and a credit to the contractor teams.\u201d\n\nL\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor is MODEC\u2019s fifth FPSO to be delivered to West Africa. The company currently operates two FPSOs in the region, in Ghana and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire."
